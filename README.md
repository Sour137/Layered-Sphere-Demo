# Layered Sphere Demo

 This is a demo of a spherical implementation of marching squares. The different elevations are terraced to create a nearly flat surface at every point. As a part of the world generation drainage basins are algorithmically created and amalgamated with a region detection algorithm along with land masses and oceans.
